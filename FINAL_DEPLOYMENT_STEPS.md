# Final Deployment Steps

## Your Application is Ready for Deployment!

I've prepared everything you need to deploy your Cakes and Memories Order Form application. Here's exactly what you need to do:

## Step 1: Run the Deployment Script (Optional)

You can run the deployment script I created to verify everything works:

```bash
cd /Users/apcaballes/cakes-and-memories-cebu-order-form
./deploy.sh
```

This will install dependencies and build your application.

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (use the same account that owns the repository)
3. Select your repository: `apcaballes87/cakes-and-memories-order-form`
4. Click "Deploy"

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables

After Vercel finishes the initial deployment:

1. Go to your project dashboard in Vercel
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Click "Environment Variables" in the sidebar
4. Add these four variables:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://congofivupobtfudnhni.supabase.co` |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImNvbmdvZml2dXBvYnRmdWRuaG5pIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE2ODc1NjkyMTQsImV4cCI6MjAwMzE0NTIxNH0.y2jsrPWt7Q_016e1o8PkM-Ayyti9yzxj3jH9hvH4DiM` |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | [Your Google Maps API key] |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | [Your Google Maps API key] |

## Step 4: Redeploy

1. Go back to the "Deployments" tab
2. Click the "Redeploy" button
3. Wait for the new deployment to complete (1-2 minutes)

## Your Application Will Be Live

Once redeployment is complete, your application will be accessible at:
`https://cakes-and-memories-order-form.vercel.app`

## Important Notes

1. The application uses a fallback Supabase project. For production use, consider creating your own Supabase project.

2. You'll need a Google Maps API key for the map functionality to work properly.

3. All your code is safely stored in your GitHub repository: https://github.com/apcaballes87/cakes-and-memories-order-form

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues during deployment, you can:

1. Check the detailed deployment guides:

   - [Full Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)

2. Run the verification script to test your build:
   ```bash

   ```

That's it! Your application is ready to be deployed and shared with the world.
