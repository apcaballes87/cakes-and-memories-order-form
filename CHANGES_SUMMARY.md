# Changes Summary

## Implemented Changes

### 1. Product Details - Default to Product 1 Only ✅
- Modified the OrderForm to ensure only one product (Product 1) is displayed by default
- Kept the "Add Another Product" button so users can add more products if needed
- Updated the product titles to show "Product 1", "Product 2", etc. correctly
- **Fixed conflicting useEffect hooks** that were causing multiple products to appear
- Removed the first useEffect that was reading the numProducts parameter and creating that many products
- Kept only one useEffect that ensures exactly one product exists by default

### 2. Time Event - Dropdown Options ✅
- Replaced the time input field with a dropdown select element
- Added options from 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM (1 hour apart):
  - 10:00 AM
